"""Pharmacogenomic passport (report 06 / PGX) over verified SNP-array observations.

Report 06 is the most useful thing this project can deliver from data it already has — and
the easiest place to publish something false, because the conventional output of a
pharmacogenomic panel is a *diplotype* (`CYP2C19 *1/*2`) and a *phenotype* ("metabolizador
lento"), and a consumer array can almost never support either.

Two facts make the usual shortcut wrong:

1. A star allele is defined by a set of positions. Observing three of CYP2C19's defining
   SNPs and finding none of them says "nenhum dos alelos testados foi detectado", **not**
   `*1`. `*1` is the reference haplotype, an assertion about every defining position,
   including the ones the chip never carried. Reporting `*1/*1` from a partial panel
   converts NÃO TESTADO into NÃO DETECTADO — the exact substitution report 09 exists to
   prevent.
2. A diplotype needs phase. Two heterozygous calls in one gene are consistent with two
   different diplotypes, and an array provides no read-level evidence to separate them.

So this module reports what was observed, states per gene exactly why a diplotype could not
be established, and refuses to emit a phenotype without one. When a curated allele-definition
registry *is* supplied — hash-pinned, with its source cited — it computes which defining
alleles were interrogated and which were detected, and still withholds the diplotype unless
that registry declares the panel complete for the gene.

CYP2D6 deserves its own mention: its clinically important variation is structural
(hybrids, duplications, deletions), which array genotyping does not resolve at any locus.
It is already listed in `UNSUPPORTED_ARRAY_CLAIMS` and is never diplotyped here.
