"""Genome Completeness & Blind Spots — the classification behind report 09 (GCM).

The catalogue has declared report 09 since v3.0 and the approved template is sealed in the
store, but nothing computed its content. That gap matters more than a missing document:
report 09 is the one that keeps a *silent* result from reading as a *negative* one. Without
it, "rs6025 does not appear in the report" is indistinguishable from "rs6025 was tested and is
absent", which is the single most consequential false negative an array can produce.

Every target in the registry lands in exactly one class:

``OBSERVADO``      assayed, called, and usable for interpretation.
``NO-CALL``        the chip carries the locus but this sample has no valid genotype.
``NÃO TESTADO``    the locus is not on this array at all. Nothing can be said about it.
``NÃO REPORTÁVEL`` observed, but excluded from interpretation — an unresolved
                   cross-platform conflict, or orientation that was never verified, so the
                   reported allele could be the complement of the true one.
``NÃO DETECTADO``  assayed, called, and the assessed allele is absent — the only class that
                   licenses a negative statement, and only for that locus.

`NÃO DETECTADO` requires the registry to declare which allele was being looked for. Where
`assessed_allele` is absent the locus stays `OBSERVADO` and the matrix says why: reading a
genotype without knowing the risk allele cannot establish absence, and guessing one would be
an invented clinical assertion of exactly the kind section 6 forbids.

Beyond the per-locus classes there are whole variant classes an array cannot see at any
locus — CNV, SV, repeat expansions, HLA, CYP2D6 structural alleles, mosaicism, deep intronic
variation. Those are reported separately as structural blind spots, because they are not
gaps in this sample but limits of the platform.
